# Popular Movies

Project for Udacity's Associate Android Developer Fast Track Nanodegree Program (Updated for 2025).

In this project we had to implement an app that would fetch and display data of popular movies from The Movie Database website (https://www.themoviedb.org). Other requirements:

* Show movies in a grid of movie posters
* Allow display of details of movies when selected
* Allow users to view and play trailers
* Allow users to read reviews of a selected movie
* Allow the user to add favorite movies to a local repository
* Allow the user to switch the sorting criteria: Popular Movies, Highest rated movies and Favorites
